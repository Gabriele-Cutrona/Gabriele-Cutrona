### Hi there!!!

Hi, my name is **Gabriele Cutrona**, I'm an italian :it: student, I was born February 9, 2010 (CE, if anyone was wondering)

Since I was little my passion has been Computer Science (Or Information Technology, or whatever you call it in english, i'm not even sure they're synonims)

I started playing with computers when i was like, i don't know, eight? My first laptop üíª (my mother's) had Windows 7 on it, still feels like a very long time ago, and I used it from time to time, until it broke when I was 10/11. Then I started using an old PC üñ•Ô∏è, it had windows 7 but I instantly upgraded to Windows 10, and then, when it came out in 2021, Windows 11. But Windows was slow, so it was at that time that I learned about **Linux** üêß (Akchtually, it's *GNU/Linux*). My first distro was Linux Mint, then I used a variety of distros and learned a lot about operating systems

I currently have a laptop bought at the beginning of 2023, I dual boot Windows 11 (I use it rarely) and Arch Linux (My configuration [here](https://github.com/Gabriele-Cutrona/.dotfiles))

I want to become a developer, that's for sure, but I'm not 100% sure about *what*. Currently I'm studying web development on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), and I'll study a variety of things in the next years of high school (as of now, May 12 2024, I'm in the first year) about... I don't know all the program, but there's definitely Web Development, Databases, Python, C++, and... that's all I know, I'll gather more information
