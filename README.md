### Hello there! ^w^
I'm **Gabriele Cutrona**, I'm an Italian 🇮🇹 student

I've loved computers since when I was around eight.<br />
(literally before discovering them my life was miserable I didn't know what to do all day)

First Windows 7/10/11 🪟 but then... the 🐧 penguin struck me<br />
I first learned about linux in 2019/2020, first Linux Mint, I tried a variety of distros, in order to then settle with [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) (BTW) in 2021,
when I was 11 years old, and I've been daily driving ever since. NixOS feels like the only distro that could, maybe, one day, convince me. But I don't know yet.

I used KDE Plasma for a long time, but for more than a year now I've been daily driving [Hyprland](https://hypr.land), dotfiles [here](https://github.com/Gabriele-Cutrona/.dotfiles)

#### About me
I love anime, TV shows, programming and videogames. The end, that's 90% of what I do all day. And It's awesome.

I have tried to learn japanese in middle school because... boredom. And I have managed to NOT rage quit... but I did quit a couple of times.
I plan to eventually start again in smaller, more consistent steps, luckly most of the knowledge I gained from preivous attempts remains with me still.

#### My Goals and progress
- 🏫 I'm a high schooler (third year)
- 🌐 I learned the basics of **Web Development** thanks to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)
	- I'm currently going on (databases and **backend** in general) on my own, but *TOP* was a great guide at the beginning
 - 🎮 I'm also interested in **Game Development**, and I'm starting with the **Godot Engine**
	- I might also eventually delve in more popular (absolutely **PROPRIETARY**, bleah) engines or lower level tools
 - 🖥️📱 I plan to learn desktop and mobile **App Development**
 	- probably something like C++ or Kotlin, but I have not started anything yet
