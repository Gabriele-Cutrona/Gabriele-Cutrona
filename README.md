### Hi there! 👋

Hi, my name is **Gabriele Cutrona**. I'm an Italian 🇮🇹 student, born on February 9, 2010 (CE, if anyone was wondering)

#### About Me
Since I was little, my passion has been Computer Science (or Information Technology, or whatever you call it in English; I'm not even sure they're synonyms). I started playing with computers when I was around eight

My first laptop (which was not mine) had Windows 7 on it, which still feels like a very long time ago. I used it from time to time until it broke when I was 10/11

Then I started using an old PC 🖥️. It had Windows 7, but I instantly upgraded to Windows 10, and then, when it came out in 2021, Windows 11. But Windows was slow, so it was at that time that I learned about **Linux** (akchtually, it's *GNU/Linux*). 

My first distro was Linux Mint, then I used a variety of distros and learned a lot about operating systems.

I currently have a laptop bought at the beginning of 2023. I dual boot Windows 11 (which rarely sees the light of day) and Arch Linux. My config is [here](https://github.com/Gabriele-Cutrona/.dotfiles).

#### My Goals
I want to become a developer, and currently, I'm studying web development on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). I'll study a variety of things in the next years of high school (as of now, May 12, 2024, I'm in the first year), even though two hours a week is really too little...
