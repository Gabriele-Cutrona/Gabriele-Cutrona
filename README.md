### Hi there!!!
Hi, my name is **Gabriele Cutrona**, I'm an italian student, I was born February 9th, 2010 (CE, if anyone was wondering)

Since I was little my passion has been Computer Science (Or Information Technology, or whatever you call it in english, i'm not even sure they're synonims)

I want to become a developer, that's for sure, but I'm not 100% sure about *what*. Currently I'm studying web development on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
